Consider a deck of 21 cards. The configuration is 3 piles, 7 cards each. The victim chooses a card in one of the piles
and just states the pile in which his/her card resides. The trick involves 3 rounds of "shift" and "shuffle" operations
described below, post which the chosen card is found at the 11th position from the top.

"shift"

If the chosen pile is not the middle one, exchange it with the middle one; If it is already the middle one, no-op

"shuffle"

Pick up the piles from left to right and place them one below the other; Now populate the 3 piles by picking cards in
order and placing them in order from the left to the right piles

The position numbering is as follows:

1 8  15
2 9  16
3 10 17
4 11 18
5 12 19
6 13 20
7 14 21

Lets take an example to illustrate the working. Say chosen card is in position 1 - lets track the position of the chosen
card after each "shift" and "shuffle" operation

start   1	row, col = (1, 1)
shift   8   row, col = (1, 2)
shuffle 10  row, col = (3, 2)
shift   10  row, col = (3, 2)
shuffle 4   row, col = (4, 1)
shift   11  row, col = (4, 2)
shuffle 11  row, col = (4, 2)

As you see it converges to pos 11 at row, col = (4, 2) - this is exactly the center of the grid above. I wrote a program
that simulates the trick for different pile sizes and number of piles and all starting positions and in each case it
converges to the exact mid of the grid (i.e. math.floor(pos / (num_piles * pile_sz)) + 1

There is some intuition behind this as we are always moving the pile of interest to the middle, however
mathematically speaking, can it be proven that it converges

If one takes a (2n+1, 2m+1) matrix and chooses any element in  it and keeps performing transpose and col exchange
with mid operations - we will end up with (the chosen element in  (n+1, m+1) position

Col is not hard to see as the game is intentionally moving the candidate column to be middle one so that is fine..
so independently reasoning can be done about row where the answer resides…after first round it could be either
in 3, 4, or 5 th row if you lay down the cards and observe…so effectively you have (2 to 4) cards on top of potential answer
..in the next round  7 prior cards occupy upto row 3 (partially) then you add (2-4) more cards and that forces you
 to be in 4th row and exactly that row it does not throw you out of that row..post that shift operation if not
 already brings the column to middle
